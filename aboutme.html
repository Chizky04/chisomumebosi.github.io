									<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

								<p>Hi, I'm Chisom. An Enthusiastic, Resourceful and Dedicated Data Analyst, Customer service/support manager, tech savvy personnel, administrator, and proficient in B2B services in various sectors (commercial, retail, SME, private) and otherwise with good diplomacy in dealing with customers issues and passionate about solving logical and analytical problems by asking questions and gaining insights and informing business decisions from available data.<br>
								 Having this mindset of solving problems and proffering solutions in diverse phases of life, I have always enjoyed solving analytical and logical problems in general. This drew my passion for data, having seen that we live in a data driven world, and it is well known that strong institutions are built on data and their ability to solve big problems which rely heavily on data.</p>
								<p>The passion for providing adequate solutions to problems, humanly and otherwise made me began my career in customer service management which I was recognized and outstanding, hence I decided to expand my horizons to the data world there by acquiring more experience in collecting, transforming, and organizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions, coupled with an excellent understanding and proficiency of platforms for effective data analysis. </p>
								<p>With over 5-years work experience in the power utility and banking sector in Nigeria, I have been dealing with data including customers data in various analytical job-roles. My experience so far has helped me to develop a great capacity to effectively communicate and collaborate with both internal and external stakeholders, in addition to the ability to translate data findings into business solutions.</p>
								<p>I have experience in collecting, transforming, and organizing data for analysis to help make informed decisions, coupled with an excellent understanding and proficiency of platforms for effective data analysis. I have acquired so many certifications in data analysis, business analysis and many more. Also participated in so many bootcamps and challenges in data analysis as well as various volunteering programs to enhance the skills of young individuals pivoting into the data analysis field</p>
